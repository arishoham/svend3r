# SVEND3R

Introducting Svend3r, a plug and play charting library for Svelte!

## Why Svelte for Charts?

By integrating D3 with Svelte, we get the best of both worlds: D3's incredible tools for translating information from the data space to the pixel space and Svelte's optimized DOM interaction. Everything you need to develop great visualizations - markup, styling, and JavaScript - can be done in a single file. Instead of using D3 to manipulate the DOM, Svelte uses {#each} blocks to render chart elements and {#if} blocks to handle conditional logic. This approach also helps lighten the load of D3 by only using a few libraries for each chart.

## Why Svend3r?

Even though there are great resources for building your own charts with Svelte, including [Pancake](https://pancake-charts.surge.sh/) (from Rich Harris) and [Layer Cake](https://layercake.graphics/) (from Michael Keller), the Svend3r team wants to make it even easier. There can be a steep learning curve when integrating technologies like Svelte and D3. Wouldn't you rather spend your time using charts than building them?

Svend3r is here to lighten the load. We've provided a set of plug and play charts that will integrate seamlessly into your next Svelte project. Just copy and paste our code directly into a new component file, import your data (or pass it down as a prop), and voila…you've got a chart!
