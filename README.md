# Svend3r  v0.1.0-beta

## Introducing Svend3r, a plug and play D3 charting library for Svelte!

There are great resources for building your own charts with Svelte, including [Pancake](https://pancake-charts.surge.sh/) (from Rich Harris) and [Layer Cake](https://layercake.graphics/) (from Michael Keller), but the Svend3r team wants to make it even easier. Wouldn't you rather spend your time using charts than building them?

# How do I use Svend3r?
## - Head to the [Svend3r.dev](https://www.svend3r.dev/) homepage
